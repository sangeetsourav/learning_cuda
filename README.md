## My Journery with CUDA

This repository contains small CUDA programs and experiments I built while learning GPU programming.

ðŸš€ Goal

To explore the CUDA programming model, practice writing parallel algorithms, and better understand GPU performance and memory management.

ðŸ“¦ Contents

- monte_carlo_pi/ â€” Estimate Ï€ using parallel random sampling on the GPU. It uses the **CUDA Runtime API** with **unified memory**.
