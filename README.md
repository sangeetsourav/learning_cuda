## My Journery with CUDA

This repository contains small CUDA programs and experiments I built while learning GPU programming.
Currently, it includes a simple Monte Carlo simulation implemented using the CUDA Runtime API.

ðŸš€ Goal

To explore the CUDA programming model, practice writing parallel algorithms, and better understand GPU performance and memory management.

ðŸ“¦ Contents

- monte_carlo_pi/ â€” Estimate Ï€ using parallel random sampling on the GPU.

ðŸ›  Requirements

- NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
- CUDA Toolkit installed
